\chapter{Conclusion}

This thesis introduces a novel approach to generating a more compact proof of liabilities. 
Leveraging a fresh circuit design, along with leveraging prior proofs and the folding scheme, we achieved notable reductions in proof size. 
This smaller proof position itself well to be generated daily, and even at higher frequencies.
Our analysis demonstrates the superior performance of the folding scheme combined with the updated circuit, compared to the existing model. 
The significance of a more concise proof of liabilities cannot be overstated, serving as a cornerstone for broader adoption of robust proof of solvency.

To complete the proof of solvency for marketplace integration, a proof of assets is imperative. 
One challenge in this endeavor lies in conducting proofs for multiple currencies. 
However, by employing the folding scheme, we can segment the proof of assets into currency-specific proofs before conducting the folded proof, mitigating this complexity.
