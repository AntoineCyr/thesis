Bitcoin is recognized as the world's first successful cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. 


\subsection{What is Bitcoin}
Bitcoin represents multiple different concepts. Bitcoin is a unit of currency used to store and transmit value among participants of the bitcoin network.
Users communicate with eachother via the bitcoin protocol. 

Andreas M. Antonopoulos describes bitcoin as 4 different innovations:
\begin{enumerate}

    \item A decentralized peer-to-peer newtork (the bitcoin protocol)
    
    \item A public transaction ledger (the blockchain)
    
    \item A set of rules for independent transaction validation and currency issuance (consensus rules) 

    \item A mechanism for reaching global decentralized concensus on the valid blockchain (Proof-of-Work algorithm)
    
    \end{enumerate}
